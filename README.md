# Full-Stack-Interview-Questions
Interview focused concepts related to OOPS, SQL, C#/.NET, Web API and DevOps.

One must understand the WHY behind those questions. 
In other words, why this question has been asked and what the interviewer is actually looking for?

There is no one single right answer to some of these questions. 

Most questions are asked in an interview to understand the logical reasoning of the candidate. It is to check if a person is able to think hard and can come up with 2-4 solutions of a particular problem.

I would request to write small code examples for these questions and understand what's happening behind the scenes. The basic requirement in any interview is that one's answers must make sense to the interviewer.

**For interviewer :** 
These questions might look easy and more theoretical but the answer to these questions would explain a lot about the candidate. 
The way candidate will explain these answers, would give an idea of his knowledge and understanding of Software Engineering concepts.
